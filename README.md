The Data for the two simulations is located in their respective folders.
However, the cvs files was to large for github, so the data has been spilt up in multipart zip files. 

To access the data press the green "code" botton and download this folder as a zip. Unpack it and unzip the files in the SGR ans PSR folders.

columns in the cvs files represent,

0. viability check. Should always be True for the data.
1. kick velocity km/s
2. kick angle theta in degree
3. kick angle phi in degree
4. mass of the progenitor star (M1) in Msun
5. mass of the companion star (M2) in Msun
6. mass of the neutron star (Mns) in Msun
7. radius of the companion star in Rsun
8. initial orbital period in days 
9. final orbital period in days
10. final orbital eccentricity
11. initial seperation in Rsun
12. final semi-major axis in Rsun
13. systemic or recoil velocity in km/s
14. initial relative velocity km/s
15. critical angle in degree. If -1 then the system has no defined critical angle.
16. misalignment angle in degree
17. asymmetry parameter
